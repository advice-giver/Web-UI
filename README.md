ADVICE GIVER PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: 

Pitch: This app 
creates room for an online global community just for you to connect with, and only one call away! You can choose to be the expert advisor, or the one who receives advice, or both! If you get a match, you both decide how to engage in the advisory relationship, assess if the advice is helpful or not, and when to move on—sounds like a normal relationship, right?
Try it out! And leave no one behind, because a more connected world should never feel lonely for anyone.
Mvp:
*Onboarding process and user profile set up for two user types: advisors and those seeking advice.  Might include photo, age, gender, life motto (optional), interests, areas of expertise, certifications (if any), social media links, geographic location, language skills etc.).
